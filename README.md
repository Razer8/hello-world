# hello-world
This project is just an exercise used for practice.
Hi. My name is Colton. The purpose of this repository is to practice using GitHub so I may use this website to my advantage to show employers what I'm capable of doing with my current knowlege of coding. I'm right now studying JavaScript at my local community college so I can become a JavaScript Developer one day. Another hobby of mine is art and I hope to use my spare time to develop passion projects in the future.
